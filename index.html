            Thank you for visiting my profile. I chosen this career because I am always been curious as to how people made softwares and websites that we are using during our daily lives and dreamt to become part of them. I may had made softwares for the sake
            of school project but I had been practicing more than what is taught in the university I had started my journey in this career. I may have little to no working experience yet but I had made this site to show to you I have the skills to showcase
            and not just all for talk.
          </p>
